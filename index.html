                        been defined by my north star: building technology that
                        guides and empowers people to intuitively make better
                        decisions and live good lives. Right now, I'm finishing
                        up my final semester at Northeastern, spending quality
                        time with friends and mentoring at TAMID. Outside of my
                        life in tech, I'm taking too long to finish the Dune
                        series, and spending time in the great outdoors via
                        hiking, cycling and snowboarding.

                    <p>
                        My early education was founded on the principle that to
                        grow the logical mind, you grow it through math. I honed
                        my skills in competitive math, and developed a love for
                        it at
                        <a href="https://hcssim.org"
                            >Hampshire College Summer Studies in Mathematics</a
                        >, where I really began to appreciate the quirks and
                        scope of the field. That curiosity pulled me into
                        computer science, where theory and application collided
                        in ways that felt both rigorous and creative. In 2020, I
                        was accepted into the
                        <a
                            href="https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/program/index.html"
                            >MIT PRIMES</a
                        >'s Computer Science Research track where I worked on a
                        project called
                        <a href="#mitprimes"
                            >Non-Fungible Objects (NFO): Hard-to-Counterfeit
                            Virtual Assets Based On Trusted-Hardware</a
                        >. Then, at Northeastern, my world expanded: I dove into
                        full stack web development and AI, soon becaming
                        obsessed with building systems as it became the medium
                        for both my quantitative and creative expression. Around
                        the time, I read
                        <a
                            href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/20527133"
                            >Superintelligence: Risks, Dangers, Strategies</a
                        >
                        which made me realize my contribution as an engineer
                        could change the world as technology shapes society.
                        This idea carried me through the past few years as I
                        worked in industry to strengthen my technical skills
                        from the best mentorship I could get (e.g.
                        <a href="https://ampion.net/">Ampion, PBC</a>,
                        <a href="https://www.ukg.com/">UKG</a>,

                        >, <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>) and
                        then put my skills to purpose through research with
                        <a
                            href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/daniel-patterson/"

                        where worked on fostering intellectual humility online.
                        All in all, my work isn’t just about writing code—it’s
                        about exploring how technology shapes the way we think,
                        interact, and solve problems. And that’s what keeps me
                        excited for what’s next.
