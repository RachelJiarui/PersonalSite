            I'm a second-year student studying a <a href="https://catalog.northeastern.edu/undergraduate/computer-information-science/computer-information-science-combined-majors/computer-science-philosophy-bs/">Bachelor's of Science degree in
            Computer Science and Philosophy</a> with a <a href="https://catalog.northeastern.edu/undergraduate/science/mathematics/mathematics-minor/#minorrequirementstext">Minor in Mathematics</a> at <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu">Northeastern University Khoury College of Computer Sciences</a>.
            My journey thus far has been all about mastering my technical ability in computer science so I can do the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_policy#:~:text=Technology%20policy%20approaches%20science%20as,policy%20is%20rarely%20post%2Dmodern.">interesting stuff</a>. I'm a people-person, so I thrive on making meaningful connections with everyone I meet and incorporating theory of law and society into building socially good, and impactful technology that.
            My academic history has been a messy conglomeration of <a href="https://maa.org/math-competitions">competitive mathematics</a>, consuming <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/works/lessig/laws_cyberspace.pdf">literature on tech law</a>, and tinkering around with <a href="https://ampion.net/">cool web developments projects</a>. Some recent enriching activities I'm involved in is a course by <a href="https://www.elettrabietti.com/syllabi/the-regulation-of-technology-in-the-digital-platform-economy">Professor Bietti at Northeastern University on Tech Regulations on the Digital Platform</a>, the <a href="https://www.nutamid.org/tech-consulting">TAMID Tech Consulting Group</a>, a research project led by <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/daniel-patterson/">Professor Patterson</a> involving code synthesization and working as an Engineer Manager at the non-profit <a href="https://www.nationalpolicedata.org/">National Police Data Coalition</a>. I'm interested in all research opportunities relating to technology in the light of law, economics, and philosophy as well as summer or fall internship opportunities to tinker on all things tech or math.
          </p>
          <!-- Body 2 -->
          <p>
            My early education was founded on the principle that math was everything. Ever since I was young, I participated in competitive math teams, went to <a href="https://www.ideamath.education/landing/home">Idea Math Camp</a>, and then much later, a six-week intensive summer studies at <a href="https://hcssim.org">Hampshire College Summer Studies in Mathematics</a>, where I really began to appreciate the quirks and scope of the field. I took my interests into computer science, where I enjoyed the marriage of theoretical thinking and practical application. In 2020, I joined <a href="https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/program/index.html">MIT PRIMES</a> where I was accepted into the Computer Science Research track to work with <a href="http://drean.io">Jules Drean</a>, a graduate student at <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu">MIT CSAIL</a>. For two years, Jules and I built together a new kind of technology: <a href="#mitprimes">Non-Fungible Objects (NFO): Hard-to-Counterfeit Virtual Assets Based On Trusted-Hardware</a>.
            At Northeastern, I expanded my knowledge about computer science into the world of full stack web development and artificial intelligence. Through tinkering with my own personal projects and working with people from <a href="https://www.edc.org/innovation-campus-artificial-intelligence-course-data-motivation">Samsung AI Program</a> and Northeastern <a href="https://www.nutamid.org/tech-consulting">TAMID Tech Consulting Group</a>, I learned a whole slew of technologies, ranging from React, Express.js, Flask, Firebase, and PyTorch.
            I soon became obsessed with computer science as it became the medium for both my quantitative and creative expression. During the same year, I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/20527133">Superintelligence: Risks, Dangers, Strategies</a> by Nick Bostrom and became engrossed with all the wild discourse relating to the emergence of ChatGPT and AI singularity. My activities this summer reflected all my interests: I entered the real-world forces for the first time as a Software Engineering Intern at a start-up <a href="https://ampion.net/">Ampion, PBC</a> where I used TypeScript, Next.js, Golang, GraphQL, SQL, Salesforce, and GCP to transform their main website navigation and optimize data querying. Then, in order to pursue my interests in AI and socially good computing, I worked with <a href=""https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/daniel-patterson/"">Professor Patterson</a> at the Northeastern University to work on his code synthesizer research project.
