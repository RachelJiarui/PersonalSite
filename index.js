  "ON FAILURE": {
    1: "There is no reason for student clubs to be so competitive. Like, I’m talking about 10% acceptance rates, multiple interviews, written applications, etc. Why are students my age determining whether or not I get to be a part of their exclusive group? Who are they to decide? Here I am, a 1st year in college, fresh out of the already hellish experience which was college admissions, doing another version of an admissions process—but for student-led clubs. I try hard to get in to a particular club, TAMID, a consulting club, acting as the liaison between start-ups desperate for free labor and students looking for work experience to put on their resume. I go to a months worth of their recruitment events: Hours and hours of listening to people lecture about their clubs, networking, followed by a lengthen written application and then a 20 minute panel interview before I get in my inbox, an email that reads “After careful consideration…” Rejected. I trudge around campus with this rejection weighing heavy on me; My face getting heated whenever I see my interviewers around campus, avoiding eye contact at all costs—but I know they don’t even recognize me.",
    2: "Embarrassment feels so bad. I try my best to avoid any situation that could result in embarrassment. But it’s so easy to find it in life: In class I run the risk of being cold called on, going out wearing a scarf for the first time, or even when I’m walking down a set of stairs—I engage my core and think to myself “god I hope I don’t trip and roll my ankle” (I did that in front of the Snell Library stairs once, and had to sit down among the crowd due to the agonizing pain). Even writing things like this, and posting them for anyone to find, I can’t help but feel embarrassed. It’s weird, invasive, and at the core of it all, I feel so uncomfortable in my own skin. It’s a feeling I can’t purposefully shake off. I wait until I forget about whatever embarrassing instance is gripping me—and every once and awhile, the memory comes flooding back and I cringe. It’s like that mind game where you’re trying to avoid thinking about The Game itself, and every time you remember it, you lose. You just lost by the way.",
    3: "One rejection from a student club was enough for me. They didn’t want me and that was that. Back then, especially being new to college, it was imperative that I felt like I belonged in a space. And I certainly didn’t feel welcome in a community which rejected all my efforts. But I also knew better to put a student-led club on a pedestal. I also genuinely did see how I could fit into the club, and really loved the connections I did make during the recruitment events. I had an inkling on where I fell short in my application, and wanted to put that lesson towards a second time, but boy was I scared; it was a second chance to get rejected and get embarrassed. But there was no one truly important in my life to witness my rejection, and that gave me some relief. I could lick my wounds in private. Publicity, after all, is part of what makes embarrassment so bad, so, I reapplied.",
    4: "My second time around, I got in (I later found out later that I barely got in, but who cares?). TAMID turned out to be one of the most life-changing communities I ever could have joined at Northeastern. Their way of education, care, and due diligence towards building a truly tight-knit community was just the right mixture of chemistry to grow my own confidence in myself. I flourished—doing committees, met some of my best friends, became their VP of Operations and then later, their Executive Vice President. With TAMID behind me, I became more ambitious than I could’ve ever imagined; pursuing research, great internships, and imagining what good I should do with my the fortune in my life.",
    5: "From that experience, I learned that confidence was my currency to handle failure and embarrassment. Before college, I think I was short on confidence change. Not because of anything in particular. It was just the result of being freshly hatched out of a turbulent, adolescence mind, and being unsure of who I really was. I’m thankful college was tender to me. TAMID became a confidence-making machine; people believed in me, I worked hard for them, and together, we achieved some beautiful goals.",
    6: "The height of my confidence-to-failure trading business was the summer of my junior year of school. I was in the midst of healing from a break up and recruiting for software engineering internships. If anyone knows anything about the software engineering recruiting season, it looks something like this: for half a year, you send in about a couple hundreds of applications, spend another hundred of hours on doing LeetCode (technical preparation platform), and hearing back from less than a handful of companies, most of which are companies telling you that they’ve rejected you. Every day, I was spending a little bit of my confidence in hopes for some success. My surplus in confidence was dwindling fast. A particularly bad experience was when I was flown out to San Francisco by Salesforce for the Tech Equality Summit pre-recruitment program to interview for Salesforce’s summer internship program. This program made it so the final interview was really easy and not competitive—everyone flown out was the first people they interviewed for the recruiting season, so everyone had an equal chance of getting in rather than fighting for limited spots on the roster. I thought I had nailed the interview, as did most kids after their interviews because they were relatively straightforward. Two weeks later, the rejection letter hit my mailbox. My heart dropped. There went probably the easiest chance for me to get into “big tech.”",
    7: "By the end of August, I was in the negatives for confidence. I had been applying since May and the failure from Salesforce, coupled with the fact that I didn’t feel quite as emotionally recovered from my break up as I thought I should have been, had taken a huge toll on me. I readied myself for a disappointing recruitment season. Numbing myself from each rejection email, I listlessly applied to random job opportunities, obsessed over LeetCode and refining my resume—and chugged on. This was the mindset I dubbed “robot rachel” (a nod to my finsta handle)—I’ve been given instructions, and I execute them again, and again, regardless of how I feel about result. Yes, I had to give it a corny name like that to be able to impersonate that kind of mindset. It made it feel more like a game, or a part of me which I switched on or off, rather than what defined my whole.",
    8: "Here, I learned how to be numb to failure. Failure was simply just a transition to the next thing—the next application, the next interview, etc. Now, failure costed less confidence than before, so I could handle buying more failures than before. Still, what happens when I hit the bottom of my wallet?",
    9: "Before I could answer that, I was saved with my first offer of the season from The Trade Desk. And I’m not being dramatic when I say “saved.” Getting an offer after months of stressing about recruiting genuinely feels like you’ve been saved. You feel as if you can enjoy life again. Okay, maybe I am being really dramatic. What followed was a reinvigoration to apply, not with the desperation of getting whatever I could get, but to get what I wanted. And that kind of recruiting is always fun. I ended up accepting an offer to go work at LinkedIn over the summer and then following that, Google in the fall.",
    10: "Then, thanks to my restless, anxious mind, I now still feel just as scared as how I started—I don’t want to try any big things in case I lose all my confidence points I’ve gained so far. What if my employers find out I’m not good enough than the rest of their interns? What if I don’t get a return offer? How will I face the recruiting season again? College and internship recruiting are hardly the place where you face the big things in life where failure really matters: I’m looking to apply for graduate school, start a family, figure out how to do a backflip on a snowboard, publish a book, start a commune, etc. As one does. Not to mention maintain things I already have right now; to lose those things I have now would be particularly hurtful because it would feel like I’m going backwards in life, and that certainly would be expensive to my confidence. But, I need to continuously be okay with failure in order to achieve these things. I can’t be afraid of “hitting the bottom of my confidence wallet.” So clearly, my mindset towards failure is all wrong. Failure shouldn’t cost my confidence.",
    11: "This brings me to some foundational questions: What is failure? Is failure real? How should we handle failure? Can you tell I’m a part-philosophy major?",
    12: "I invite you to also think about these questions. Too often, I see people like myself cringe at embarrassment, shy away from the risk of failure, and become demotivated when they do face failure. Is this what we should feel? Is failure just one of those things where people go “well that’s just life”?",
    13: "I think to one of the most famous quotes on how to handle failure: “You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.” I almost hate this quote, because it misses a pivotal part of failure: You are supposed to reflect and learn from each shot that you missed.",
    14: "Okay, so that’s something closer…whatever failure is, we’re supposed to learn something that brings us closer to what we do want. Well, then this makes failure seem way too good than what it really makes us feel. I’m pretty sure most of us feel bad when we fail at something. So if failure really is this lesson-learning thing that brings us good, then shouldn’t we feel good when we fail at something? Why do we feel bad?",
    15: "There’s a myriad of answers to why we feel bad about failure. Embarrassment. Our ego. If we lost something we care about. If there was external stakes like a family member not being able to get their medicine or something serious of that sort. Clearly, also, we can’t say “don’t feel bad about failure!” because it’s a valid emotion that should happen to some forms of failure. In fact, to look an example a little deeper, take my an example of a desperate guy asking a bunch of girls to get laid—maybe doing even sketchy things like following a girl home, being rude when the girl turns him down, etc. If he felt no sense of shame, embarrassment, or disgust towards his own behavior, then he would likely not perform the necessary introspection to see what he’s doing—causing public disturbance, disrespecting woman and his own integrity. These feelings are important because they can be great indicators that something is wrong. They are guardrails to better the individual in the same way physical pain is for protecting the body.",
    16: "So failure invokes—and should invoke—bad feelings. But the key is not to let those feelings calcify into self-worth—and that’s where I didn’t know about failure before. Before, I thought it was only normal to lose part of my self-worth when I faced failure. The shame or embarrassment I feel from a failure isn’t the truth of who we are; it’s a message. And it’s our job to decipher what it's trying to tell us: Was that failure a sign of misalignment, or simply a rough draft of the person I’m becoming? This is where the growth lies—not in numbing ourselves to failure, nor romanticizing it as inherently noble, but in learning to feel the sting without making it our identity. Embarrassment is temporary, but the lessons we can learn are permanent. Because in the end, failure isn’t about how far we’ve fallen—it’s about what we choose to do once we’ve landed.",
    17: "So here’s my working definition of failure now: it’s not a reflection of who I am, but a process that I can use to shape the good person I want to become. It's a teacher, a threshold, a test of what I care about most. And maybe, if I’m lucky—or just stubborn enough to keep trying—every failure will be less about what I’ve lost, and more about what I’ve just begun to learn.",

  "AUTONOMY AND TECHNOLOGY": {
    1: "A new default to escaping boredom is a few finger taps away. Perusing social media. Whether it be sitting on the train or when you're trying to fall asleep at night, the notifications on our pocket-sized phones draw us back to the digital world, where billions of netizens post, react, and share content. In these social networks lies a near constant in-flow of information, curated to ensnare our attention. Attention, to the businessman behind the social media platform, is the unit of money in this new economy [1]. With the control of our attention, the businessman puts up to auction our attention; he receives bids from advertisements, political campaigns, and access to deeper mechanisms within our own mind to trap our attention further.",
    2: "Knowing this, the businessman today wants to capture as much as our attention as they can. They do this by deploying algorithmic recommendation systems. They can be defined as such: A recommendation system is an information filtering system that determines what items are shown to a particular user. An algorithmic recommendation system refers to when the above system incorporates formalized, computational procedures, rules, or instructions, which execute some function or purpose [2].",
    3: "The term “attention” is a broad, often overfitted term encompassing a vague meaning of “a mind’s focus.” In “The Principles of Psychology,” William James wrote that attention “is the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what may seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought…It implies withdrawal from some things in order to deal effectively with others.” [3] But more than just the omission of one thing over another, the things we pay attention to becomes what we remember [4]. Our memories, and how we feel when we recall these memories, encompasses the rational, conscious processes which contribute to the careful deliberation of our decisions [5]. This includes decisions that makes the businessman money; decisions such as which advertisements to click on, which videos to watch, and how long we should stay on the platform.",
    4: "Algorithmic recommendation systems are one of the many design and algorithmic choices in our digital devices that farm our attention. I claim that algorithmic recommendation systems weaken the autonomy of our minds in a way that is uniquely dangerous and requires legal action.",
    5: "Firstly, let us explore what autonomy is. “Autonomy” used here is the autonomy of will, defined by Kant: “the property of the will by which it is a law to itself.” [6] Here, Kant describes the important of self-rule, which Dworkin describes as the independence of one’s deliberation and choice from manipulation by others. Today, algorithmic recommendation systems aim to degrade our ability for deliberation to better do their jobs: Manipulate us to make decisions they want us to on their social media platforms.",
    6: "One way to view algorithmic recommendation systems is that they are a subset of the systems which manipulates the informational topology on digital platforms. They mold the network of content for a user by aiding in the destruction of connections between certain kinds of content but magnifying the connections between other kinds of content. A user’s autonomy on a social media platform driven by algorithmic recommendation systems experiences varying levels of intensity of two harms: 1) Obstruction of Intellectual Humility & Distortion of Reality. 2) Purposeful and Addictive Manipulation.",
    7: "1 Obstruction of Intellectual Humility & Distortion of Reality: Intellectual humility is the value of acknowledging that your argument is weaker or not sound when you are given justifiable counterarguments. I derive my definition from philosopher Allan Hazlett, who describes intellectual humility as the “excellence in attributing ignorance to yourself, withholding attributing knowledge yourself, and questioning whether you know,” and Nabeel Gillani, a philosopher and computer scientist, who says that intellectual humility is knowing that “we are [not] at the center of the universe and that our own ways of knowing are [not] the only ones with merit.” Intellectual humility is fundamental and necessary to sustain meaningful public discourse—something vital for democracy.",
    8: "With the emergence of the internet, we saw a flood of information and knowledge to consume. However, recommendation systems serve to direct these flows of information, creating “filter bubbles” which confide us within a context that rewards us with content we have a history of reacting strongly to. This results in a disconnection within the informational topology of the platform. There are two forms in which this disconnection could come about: 1) Purposeful disconnection. 2) Unnoticed disconnection. The first resulting in “echo chambers,” which is described as a “social epistemic structure from which other relevant voices have been actively excluded and discredited,” and the second resulting in “epistemic bubbles,” which is described as a “social epistemic structure in which other relevant voices have been left out, perhaps accidentally.” [7]",
    9: "In both forms of disconnection, individuals have lost their intellectual humility by being algorithmically exposed to select quantities and intensities of content that distort reality. It could be as inconsequential as seeing numerous cat videos which leads to an assumption that there are more cat-people than dog-people, or as consequential as entering online “manospheres” echo chambers and viewing women as the lesser sex [8]. The epistemic structure users exist in does not reflect reality, but more importantly, it hardens our wills, desires, and habits with algorithmic reinforcement of our beliefs to an excessive extent. An extent which uniquely erodes our ability for sound judgement, self-reflection, and growth for the betterment of a businessman.",
    10: "Already, there are multiple proven examples of social media platforms distorting reality to an extreme [9]. But the distorted reality caused by recommendation systems is our loss of our autonomy to be able to easily manifest new desires, wills, and habits, and thus, lowering the change of gaining intellectual humility.",
    11: "2 Purposeful and Addictive Manipulation: According to the Dictionary of Sociology, manipulation is the action of causing a social actor to think and act in a way compatible with the interests of the initiator, and not with his original interests, by intentionally distorting the truth and leaving the impression of freedom of thought and decision[10]. Manipulation is a covert act, it’s actions described best by Robert Noggle, who wrote that “there are certain norms or ideals that govern beliefs, desires, and emotions. Manipulative action is the attempt to get someone’s beliefs, desires, or emotions to violate these norms, to fall short of these ideals.” Indeed, many believe that manipulation is a form of trickery which attempts to trick someone into adopting any faulty mental state—belief, desire, emotion, etc.3 By this definition, manipulation is not autonomy-preserving, which leaves the victim vulnerable to subordination and abuse. At a political level, manipulation weakens the democratic institution and is the prerequisite to tyranny.",
    12: "What makes software manipulative? Uri Sarid, CTO of MuleSoft, declares intent in programming models as “a desired goal or end state [that the] software systems autonomously figure out how to simply ‘make it so.’ Humans set the boundaries and constraints…”[11] In algorithmic recommendation systems used in advertisement businesses like Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok, the intent is to maximize your attention spent on their app and to get you to click on advertisements on these apps. In algorithmic recommendation systems used in subscription-based businesses like Spotify, and Netflix, the intent is to make sure you are using their platform frequently (more confident insurance that you will remain on the platform) and that you enjoy their platform (possibly to garner the reputation that people should subscribe to Netflix.) It is abundantly clear, then, that algorithmic recommendation systems adopt and act upon the intent of its businessmen. More notably, these are not the intentions of people. Even if some of the outcomes of these intentions, such as good TV show recommendations leading to find your favorite show ever, the fact that the intentions of algorithmic recommendation systems and their users do not line up is a prerequisite to manipulation and manipulation harms.",
    13: "Now that it’s understood that algorithmic recommendation systems have intents opposite to its users, how do these systems manipulate their users for their own intents and what is the extent of their harms against autonomy? To understand the extent of how algorithmic recommendation systems are manipulative and threaten one’s autonomy significantly, one can look at the extent of what it does to achieve its intent.",
    14: "Some algorithmic recommendation systems like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube have intents which incentivize cultivating algorithms to create addiction in their user to maximize their time spent on their platforms. This magnifies the manipulative harms of degrading one’s autonomy by tenfold. According to Peg O’Connor, addiction is “a total abdication of reason, a messy tangle of emotions and a lack of will.”[12] Autonomous decision, according to Rebecca L. Walker, requires for it to be not irrational[13]. This means that for an algorithmic recommendation system to induce addictive behavior is equivalent to robbing people of the rational deliberation which allows them to make decisions, thus making it one of the most expansive psychological occupations of one’s autonomy. Even for recommendation algorithms that do not have addictive behavior at their forefront (ex: Netflix, Reddit, etc.), most take advantage of immense information on the digital identity and the digital context of the user’s every online decision and leverage complex mathematical and design techniques to predict and “nudge” a user’s behavior on their platform[14]. The algorithmic recommendation systems utilize psychological and mathematical theory of ensuring execution of their intent.",
    15: "We’ve shown that algorithmic recommendation systems degrade autonomy by hindering people from changing their own desires and beliefs and by manipulating its users. However, why are algorithmic recommendation systems an imperative problem we must confront? What are the harms which make these systems an urgent crisis?",
    16: "The biggest reason why we must confront these recommendation systems urgently and with strength is because we are increasingly interacting with these systems on a day-to-day basis. The average American checks their mobile device 159 times a day, spending about 2 hours and 14 minutes per day on social media alone [15]. As individuals increasingly engage with these systems, the degradation of our autonomy and our democracy becomes more pronounced. The substantial frequency of usage alone prompts critical examination of the implications for individual autonomy and the need for vigilant oversight in safeguarding user interests.",
    17: "But more than just oversight, I believe that there is a need for legal intervention to prevent the harms of algorithmic recommendation systems. We must realign the intentions of these businesses and how they use algorithmic recommendation systems on their users. Using Lessig’s four modalities of regulation, one may argue that we should social norms to change the culture in how tech companies see themselves in society [16]. Certainly, this happened within American journalism, which established their own call for a code of ethics and journalism standards within the business. However, it is equally imperative that we do not depend on the tech space to do it on their own without the support of law and regulation.",

  "MANIFESTO FOR EDUCATION": {
    1: "I had this great professor one Spring. The whole classroom was his stage, and everything in it was his props, including us, the students. He walked from one side to the other, used us as physical pointers on the board, stood on rolling chairs just so he could draw a giant diagram of a complicated system so everyone could see. It was often bizarre, when so many teachers would be confined to a few feet in front of the room and only really look at us in the eye to see if we had any questions, not if we were really present in their teaching.",
    2: "There was one funny thing he kept doing. Calling something “beautiful.” We’d snicker. It was such an odd word to describe something, especially when this was a difficult theory class where we were all worried if we would get passing grades—I mean, I would hardly call that a “beautiful” situation to be in. After the chuckles died off, we realized what we saw: wonder. Our professor wasn’t just teaching; he was telling us a story. A story of how this theory came to be, the trials and tribulations it goes through, and at last, the conclusion of the story: How beautiful it is to him. His own personal stake into this subject struck the same kind of awe and connection that a good story does. Each chapter in his classroom was one which shared not just knowledge, but passion. He was passing down a lineage of passion.",
    3: "Artificial intelligence will never replace teachers, and should never replace teachers. Pure information, even when neatly packaged to our tastes, is not the only thing we’re seeking from our teachers. It lacks personal stake, human experience and love. And thus, there is no storytelling. I say this because we find ourselves at the precipice of losing our understanding of education to the idea that artificial intelligence and the tools that come with it diminish the purpose of our teachers. Not only our teachers, but our classrooms, our relationships with other students, and our time in those spaces of diverse thought, theory and connection.",
    4: "Education is to develop critical and free thinking such that each one of us can pursue the truth. We do this for the mission to make beautiful things, to find what’s possible, and to do good. This is a mission that should be defined uniquely by each individual and their lived experiences, guided but never dictated by anyone else but that individual. A lot of people’s purposes today, however, is defined by factors outside of this mission: What makes them the most money, what is more prestigious, etc. The Beautiful, The Possibilities and The Good are commonly not priorities in today’s student body, and oftentimes rightfully so given their circumstances (socioeconomic, etc.)",
    5: "My hope is that education will one day be able to serve these purposes wholly. And that tools like artificial intelligence brings us closer to this ideal, not away. Today, AI tools make knowledge more accessible and help automate intermediary tasks that don’t directly contribute to a person’s core mission. But it also threatens opportunities for growth in critical thinking, the exchange of diverse perspectives, and the space for leisure, play, and reflection—essential ingredients for creativity. Communities, policy, classrooms, and the individual all play a part in defining this future. We must remember that education is not merely the transfer of information—it never was. If we are to embrace the tools of artificial intelligence, we must do so with respect for what cannot be automated: the spark in a teacher’s eye when they call an equation beautiful; the magical moment when an idea first clicks; the slow, quiet shaping of a mind that dares to ask its own questions. Let us choose, again and again, to make education a place where the beautiful, the possible, and the good remain our highest aims.",
  },
  "MY VALUES SO FAR": {
    1: "One major part of my mental health journey and discovering what will make a fulfilling career is living life value-driven. Values are the motifs that structure our every action. They are not merely goals; they are the reasons for those goals. And not just reasons for goals, but reasons to do the hard things in life. To keep persisting despite it all.",
    2: "I found that last bit particularly motivating when in some of my darkest moments, I felt myself wondering whether I could bear the anxiety, panic, the fear of my world as I experienced it.",
    3: "It isn’t easy to define what our values are. It’s difficult to stop being drawn back to old nihilistic habits of thinking and easy to replace our values with goals; I want to make X amount of money, get Y jobs, and live at Z. These are far more tangible and relatable to our most primitive motivators like the feelings of pride, pleasure, etc. But these aren’t reasons to live our lifetime. In fact, at the end of these goals—say you reach them—is actually quite empty. You hear stories of people who became millionaires quick but felt not much more fulfillment than the average joe, and while that may sound insufferable, one could relate by reflecting on some of our own past goals that we’ve achieved, and see how we still find ourselves living in unsatisfactory ways.",
    4: "This is all to say that I’ve made it an imperative goal of mine to define my values. Why do I do what I do? What will I be defined by?",
    5: "For me, it’s important that “I do the most good I can” in my life. I will define what that means in the rest of my writings below:",
    6: "Let us imagine a graph in which there are two axes, X and Y, where the X-axis represents the passage of time and Y represents the total amount of suffering in the world. Let us not assume that the calculation of this total amount of suffering in the world is merely a summation of a discrete number that represents each individual person's suffering at that point in time. How we can imagine this total being calculated is not what I want to talk about right now. In fact, it’s on purpose that I don’t define this because I don’t know how to, even theoretically so.",
    7: "(Let me entertain a divergent into why I can’t define this. At face value, one might think that suffering is the combination of all the unwanted pain in the world. But, there is many unwanted pains that have resulted in great good in the world, e.g. people who go through mental health crisis can now talk about value-driven living. Thus, if suffering were to be defined as such, it would no longer be a metric I am trying to minimize, as that would also decrease some good in the world. Maybe a closer way to think of suffering is to think of it as the function of unwanted pain - positive outcome, each multiplied by some arbitrary weight based on how we want each value to impact the function. But even that doesn’t capture the complexity of measuring suffering as something I want to minimize, because there are certainly cases in which a huge positive outcome still doesn’t justify unwanted pains, e.g. Those Who Walk Away from Omelas. This function can be good heuristic, though, to understand a semblance of what suffering might be.",
    8: "Imagine that there is a trajectory on this graph that can represent the world history without the existence of myself. However, with the existence of myself, my existence should contain contributions such that the trajectory of this new graph, graph', never deviates too far up on the suffering axis, and overall, deviates below the original suffering axis.",
    9: "This is one major part of what I think means that I did a good job in life. More neatly said: I better have roughly improved the quality of humanity's existence by existing. (This is an expectation that does not and should not apply to everyone; I believe I should be held to this expectation because I likely lie within the top 1% of privilege—the combination of how well my social, economic, familial/relationship, health, personal preferences align myself with access to resources for a good life)",
    10: "The other part pertains to the duties and responsibilities of care I have as Rachel Chen, and how well I achieved those commitments. Some examples of such duties and responsibilities include my duty as a daughter (to take care of my parents as they age, to be a good sister, etc.), my responsibility as someone's best friend or partner, my responsibility as a teammate at a job, etc. How well I performed at each of these special responsibilities should also be considered along with the net improvement of all of the rest of humanity. The reason I point this out is because of the case in which there exists a person who was a bad, negligent father but who may have been a scientist who cured a disease—while he may have decreased overall suffering for all of humanity, there are certain qualities of integrity, loyalty, and other virtues which bind us to one another and make us worth fighting for one another's happiness, that he has failed to uphold.",
    11: "This philosophy blends together the very utilitarian view of optimizing for some value of happiness with the feminist philosophy, the ethics of ethic, and substantive moral partialism + other arguments such as Socrates' preachings of the good being our virtues. How this blend interacts with one another (is it 50/50? Should one take priority over the other in different scenarios?) is a question I have remaining. Sometimes, the two support one another in their respective goals. Sometimes, they are at odds with one another. When the two are seemingly at odds with one another, what should one do?",
    12: "While I’m figuring that bit out, this is how I’ll be living my life.",

  "A HISTORY OF MY OBSESSIONS": {
    1: "During an interview for a position at a start-up, I was asked “whats makes you ready for what a startup demands?” And I think to answer this question, we must look at what a start up is, and what is the fuel to that process. Start-ups are the process of starting something new and putting in the time that is required for incubating a new born idea. This part of putting together singe cells into a zygote into a child is fueled by largely by obsession. Obsession. An idea or thought that continually preoccupies or intrudes on a person's mind. For it is only in the obsessive mind does work becomes play, a necessity, the end-all-be-all, all at once.",
    2: "It got me thinking about some of my own obsessions—and also how I view putting in hard work. In Silicon Valley, we’re beginning to see a rise of 9-9-6: Working from 9am to 9pm for 6 days a week. It’s not necessarily that you’re in the office those times; Someone put the 9-9-6 experience aptly as such: It’s about being in the working mind from those hours, and shortening many other aspects of your life (like uber-eating foods, taking meetings at the gym, etc.) such that you can maximize those hours.",
    3: "I, and many others, immediately scoff at such a work-life balance. Work shouldn’t take up your life! It’s not what is beautiful about living. But then I think about the times in which I put in my own kinds of 9-9-6s—and how when I did those hours, it didn’t feel like “work”. It was purpose. It was the beautiful life.",
    4: "So let’s take a little tour of my 9-9-6s. Not just any of them, but the most fun ones. These were things that I thought about nearly every waking moment for at least a month straight. Any less (e.g. soccer, working out, food) is ruled out from this list.",
    5: "ONE: World-building",
    6: "From ages 10 to 17, I made all sorts of stories. It started from mimicking the world of Warrior Cats—creating my own characters and plots in the pre-existing world—to creating vast new worlds, with different cultures, environments, politics, socio-economic levels, and powers.",
    7: "In my Drive, I just counted about 40 documents and about the same on my Notion. Each of the documents would either be a character / world study or an unfinished story. My most recent story was about an immortal named Sennacherib that regrettably made a woman immortal, and the consequences of making a mortal woman live forever. It was centered around a monastery in Germany whose architecture I based off of the Hohenzollern Castle. And this is why I say “world-building” was my obsession—NOT writing. Because I totally fell in love with making the world. Here’s an example of the floor plan I set up.",
    8: "project_images/obsessions/floorplan.png",
    9: "Learning how to create a convincing world meant that I had to learn about how the world works: What kinds of agriculture grows on what kinds of land?; How does one occupation changes the way they act in their communities?; How do different cultures form? My passion for world building and stories was one of the biggest influences for my intellectual curiosity and more. ",
    10: "I will publish my own book one day. ",
    11: "TWO: AP US History",
    12: "Yes, you unfortunately read that right. I was obsessed with APUSH.",
    13: "Only retrospectively did I realize I quite literally spent 9-9-6 on APUSH. It was because I became fixated on completing a foolproof wiki on every single event ever that would be covered in APUSH.",
    14: "Here is the website: https://rachelsworks.notion.site/AP-US-HISTORY-cf6b1600d6b14bc9a26f7c062c83862e?pvs=74",
    15: "My magnum opus, over 43,000 words. To put that into something meaningful, that is 172 pages if it were to be put into a book. What the hell was I on? But hey, even to this day, it still gets a couple views every day. ",
    16: "This was partnered (as if I needed more APUSH in my life during those months) with me becoming a (this is embarrassing, please stay with me now) discord moderator for Mr. Heimler, a YouTuber famous for his videos explaining APUSH topics. His discord at the time had around 25,000 users, of whom I would monitor to uphold his community rules and also provide APUSH help to. I accumulated a couple of thousands of messages on that Discord server.",
    17: "Safe to say, I got a 5 on that AP exam.",
    18: "THREE: Minecraft Baltop",
    19: "Welcome, quarantine time obsession. Unsurprisingly, there is a game in the mix. Thankfully, it wasn’t Valorant or League.",
    20: "Minecraft Baltop was a particular game style in which I joined a small server, about 30 - 50 players at a time, where we would all compete to get the highest amount of money at the end of the month. You could get money by selling to an in-game universal “shop” that had unlimited money to give if you have the resources to sell.",
    21: "To optimize getting money, you would select some high paying resources and create automatic farms to generate that resource to sell. There were a lot of actual complicated game mechanics and strategies that you have to learn in order to maximize these automatic farms. I played with these people from Britain, so I’d wake up early like 7am - 8am to play with them, or stay up really late. We built massive, massive farms together and placed in the top 3 by the end of the month, winning an astonishing $25 of real life money. Wow, so worth it.",
    22: "This lowkey changed the course of my life. Because I was playing Minecraft so much, I didn’t study too well for AP Biology, and got a 3 on the exam. It was from this exam when I decided I wouldn’t be cut out to become a doctor. Now I’m neck deep in the tech world. Look, I’m sure all this time spent optimizing farms has some relation to software engineering.",
    23: "FOUR: Truth Agent",
    24: "Imagine yourself, summer 2024. The past two years being full of politic turmoil, with BLM, the Trump vs. Harris campaign, Israel-Palestine conflict reigniting on the world stage with college campuses being one of the main actors on the other side of the camera. Invigorated, frustrated, and inspired to act, I knew that one of the most important things during times like these is learning the full picture; the truth. To be able to strip the chaos into what it is.",
    25: "This was the motivation behind a project I called the Truth Agent or Veritas. It was going to be a browser extension agent that would read over your shoulder, and highlight things on the website that they believed were manipulative or misinformation, and helped define or provide context to certain words or events.",
    26: "I would work on this the moment I got home from my internship. I ended up submitting this project to a Google Gemini Developer contest. I didn’t win anything, but I’m hoping to return to this project soon, and launch it. It’s a product I need in my life, in this digital age.",

    },
    Purpose: {
      1: "This project was under the Plural Connections Group, where we try to apply and design technologies to advance pluralism. I served as their Research Engineer for a particular project on scaffolding virtues in online spaces, particularly the virtue of intellectual humility in reddit political discourses. Intellectual humility—the recognition of the limits of one’s knowledge and a willingness to engage with opposing viewpoints—is foundational to healthy discourse. In online spaces often marked by polarization and performative certainty, fostering intellectual humility can help cultivate more respectful, open, and constructive conversations. With social media platforms increasingly contributing to misinformation and affective polarization, we asked a simple question: can we introduce better social cues into online conversations to help nudge users to communicate more humbly?",
      2: "By building a simulated Reddit-like environment populated with AI dialogue agents and feedback mechanisms, we tested whether participants would adopt more intellectually humble behaviors if they received nudges mimicking missing in-person social cues. Our broader aim was to contribute to a growing body of research on how digital environments might promote epistemic virtues like humility and empathy in a time of deepening political division.",
    },
    Design: {
      1: "We engineered a custom full-stack web application deployed on AWS that mimics a Reddit-style comment environment to enable controlled experimentation. Built with React on the frontend and Flask on the backend, the platform ran on an EC2 instance and stored data in MongoDB. The application featured seeded discussion threads and allowed participants to post replies, enabling real-time feedback loops based on comment content.",
      2: "project_images/socialcues/ui.png",
      3: "The technical infrastructure supported two primary experimental layers: a Social Cues intervention and an Environment condition. In the Social Cues treatment, we used Perspective API to analyze each unposted comment for three core attributes—respect, curiosity, and nuance. If a comment fell below a threshold on two or more dimensions, the system would pass it to an LLM (via the ChatGPT API) to generate a suggestion for improvement. Participants could revise or submit the original comment.",
      4: "project_images/socialcues/nudge.png",
      5: "To enhance the accuracy of the feedback, we collaborated closely with the Dartmouth NLP Group to develop and fine-tune an intellectual humility classifier specifically trained on political discourse. This involved experimenting with k-shot learning strategies and prompt engineering techniques to align LLM outputs with human judgments on intellectual humility. The Environment treatment used AI dialogue agents—designed to simulate intellectually humble, arrogant, or neutral personas—to reply to participants' comments based on randomized condition assignments.",
      6: "Participants were recruited via Prolific, stratified by political leaning, and asked to engage in two conversations on controversial topics (abortion, immigration, or climate change) that reflected opposing views. Pre- and post-surveys measured shifts in self-reported intellectual humility, and each participant’s behavior was scored based on their posted comments using the classifier pipeline.",
    },
    Reflections: {
      1: "While our study did not find statistically significant average effects of the real-time feedback intervention, the experimental environment yielded compelling insights. Specifically, exposure to intellectually arrogant agents led to decreased humility—both in participants’ behavior and their self-perception. This suggests the atmosphere of online conversations deeply shapes how individuals show up in discourse, independent of their intentions or the feedback they receive.",
      2: "The Social Cues intervention itself may still hold promise, but our results point to the challenge of subtlety: the nudge might have been too light-handed or not sufficiently tailored to participant expectations. We also faced limitations in classifier precision; the Perspective API occasionally misclassified comments in ways that participants may have perceived as incorrect or irrelevant.",
      3: "Going forward, we aim to refine our humility detection models using large language models fine-tuned on human judgments. We’re also preparing to launch a field experiment on Reddit using a new variant of the intervention. More broadly, this work affirms that creating epistemically virtuous online communities cannot rely solely on individual nudges—it must also consider the broader conversational context and social norms embedded in digital spaces.",
